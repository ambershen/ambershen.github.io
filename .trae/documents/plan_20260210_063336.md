I will add the 4 project blocks to the "Left Brain" section of your website, following the "minimal" aesthetic and your content requirements.

### **1. Update `styles.css`**
I will add new styles to support the project layout:
- **`.project-item`**: specialized styling for project blocks, inheriting from `.work-item`.
- **`.carousel-placeholder`**: A visual placeholder box (dashed border, light background) where you can later add your image/video carousel.
- **`.project-desc`**: Styling for the main project description.
- **`.project-details`**: A container for the "Product philosophy" and "Tech stack" sections to ensure proper spacing and hierarchy.
- **Typography**: Ensure all text uses your specified mono fonts (`Space Mono`, `JetBrains Mono`) and colors (`#0A0A0C`, `#F2EDE7`).

### **2. Update `index.html`**
I will insert the following content into the `<section class="panel-body">` of the **Left Brain** panel:

- **Project 1: Dirty Window**
  - Title & Carousel Placeholder
  - Description: "The most satisfying window you'll ever clean..."
  - Philosophy & Tech Stack

- **Project 2: PaletteMe**
  - Title & Carousel Placeholder
  - Description: "LLM-powered personal color analysis..."
  - Philosophy & Technical Approach

- **Project 3: Birth Crystal**
  - Title & Carousel Placeholder
  - Description: "Transforms birthdates into personalized 3D crystal spheres..."
  - Philosophy & Technical Approach

- **Project 4: Small Tool Bento Box**
  - Title & Carousel Placeholder
  - Description: "Tiny tools but beautifully organized..."
  - Philosophy & Technical Approach

The existing "Skills" section will be kept at the bottom of this list or integrated as appropriate.

### **Verification**
After making the changes, I will use `cloud.js` (if applicable) or simply verify the file contents to ensure the HTML structure is correct and the CSS rules are properly applied. You will be able to verify the visual result by opening `index.html`.
